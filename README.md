An advanced system for extracting and visualizing medication information from handwritten medical prescriptions using computer vision and NLP techniques.

## üîç Overview

Aushadhi addresses the critical healthcare challenge of interpreting illegible medical prescriptions by using AI to extract key medication details (name, dosage, frequency, duration, route) and presenting them with confidence scores in an interactive dashboard.

## ‚ú® Features

- Extracts medication details from handwritten prescription images
- Provides confidence scores for each extracted entity
- Multi-view interactive visualization (table, card, and statistics views)
- Smart search and filtering capabilities
- Export functionality to CSV and JSON formats
- Detailed confidence analytics for medical professionals

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo

## üìä Dataset

We used the [Illegible Medical Prescription Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehaksingal/illegible-medical-prescription-images-dataset/data) from Kaggle, containing:
- 1,000 handwritten prescription images
- Multiple handwriting styles from different physicians
- Expert annotations for medication entities
- Various prescription formats and layouts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

Our solution implements a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Adaptive thresholding and noise reduction
   - Layout analysis to identify prescription sections
   - Region of interest extraction

2. **Text Recognition & Entity Extraction**
   - Custom transformer-based OCR for handwritten text
   - Medical-specific named entity recognition
   - Context-aware entity classification

3. **Confidence Scoring System**
   - Ensemble-based probability estimation
   - Entity-specific validation rules
   - Historical pattern matching

4. **Interactive Visualization**
   - React-based dashboard with shadcn/ui components
   - Multiple view options for different use cases
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
